				<h3 id="what-is-an-emergency-fund">What is an emergency fund?</h3>
<p>Whether you like it or not, things can go wrong in your life and emergency fund is simply money that is enough to get you out of a sudden expense such as car wreck, medical expenses, or a financial crisis such as losing your job. Well, Suddenly seeing that new chothing go on 50% clearance sale doesn’t qualify as an emergency. so we’re talking about money you have saved to get you through true emergencies in life.</p>

<p>You don’t know what’s going to happen next in your life is the reason to have an emergency fund and it will come in handy if you suddenly lose your job. How are you going to cover your expenses for the next few months? let’s not talk about paying your netflix bill but electricity, food and gas? The only way is to get in to more and more debits such as credit cards or high-intrest loans if you don’t have any savings.</p>

<p>So as a critical step to improve your personal finance, it’s must to have an emergency fund and that will help you eventually to get out of your debt and not to get in to more debts. this is must if you thinking about financial independance and as whenever you are in an true emergency, you can simply withdrow this money without borrwoing it and isn’t it a relief after all?</p>

<h3 id="how-much-should-you-save-in-your-emergency-fund">How much should you save in your emergency fund?</h3>
<p>This is depend from person to person and there are no any hard and fast rule to figure the amount you need to save, the more stable your income and household are, the less you need in your emergency fund. As the recommanded strategy is to have at least three to six months of your monthly mandatory expenses.</p>

<p>If you have more than one income source or a stable perment job, it’s more like to having a three months fund is more than enough but if you got only one income source such as contract or commission based job having a six month fund can save lots of trouble in your life specially if in case you lose your job or get in to a critical illness.</p>

<h3 id="where-should-you-keep-your-emergency-fund">Where should you keep your emergency fund?</h3>
<p>Key is to have emergency fund is access to the money when you are in an emergency, so your emergency fund should be liquid enough to get it whenever you need it easilty and quickly. Idially Savings account or Money marcket account best suite to host the fund but make sure to not to mix it with your regular savings account. If you do so your fund won’t last long and it won’t be an emergency fund as whenever you want you’ll start using that money thinking you’ll settle it later but that later won’t come untill you face an emergency.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-start-building-your-emergency-fund">How to start building your emergency fund?</h3>

<h5 id="1-figure-out-how-much-you-need-to-save">1. Figure out how much you need to save</h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not mandatory to deposit your three or six month worth fund to the emergency fund at the very fist day, If you can do that you are great but even if you can’t do that, you can simply start building the fund monthly or whenever you have money but make sure to make it a consistant habit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So as the first thing, identify the amout you need to have in your emergency fund which is only the mondatory expenaces and how much you going to save monthly, come up with a number so that will help you to stick to the plan in the longer run.</p>

<h5 id="2-open-your-savings-or-money-marcket-account">2. Open your Savings or Money marcket account</h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>Create a different account for your emergency fund, else whenever you need just money for additional expences, you’ll use your emergency fund.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additional monthly expences and emergency expences are two different things, so you need to make sure you won’t use your emergency fund to cover up that additional money you have spents with your friend or doing that extra shopping.</p>

<h5 id="3-automate-it">3. Automate it</h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>Pay yourself first, that’s the key to your financial success and make sure to setup a standing order from your savings or checking account to the emergency fund, so that way you won’t miss building your fund ever again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Habit is a powerfull thing that make you automate things and keep it going forever without even thinking or worring, just like that setting up a standing order from your checking/savings account will automate your emergency fund building and you don’t even have to think about it or go through the trouble of withdrawing your money and depositing in your emergency account. See, isn’t it simple?</p>

<h3 id="know-your-emergencies-before-using-your-fund">Know your emergencies before using your fund</h3>
<p>Eventhough some sudden expense pops up looks like an emergency, you need to make sure you use your emergency fund only for true emergencies. The life insurance or the additional new cloths you got for your costume contest won’t fit as emergency and anything you know that’s going ot occur in future is also not an emergency. so when a sudden expense pops up, ask following three question to yourself to see if you really need to use your emergency fund:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is it unexpected?</li>
  <li>Is it necessary?</li>
  <li>Is it urgent?</li>
</ol>

<p>If the anser is “yes” to all or at least two questions, more likely it’s a true emergency and you are doing the right thing by using your emergency fund, but always make sure to use your fund wisely as you are are already in a emergency and it’s your only emergency fund.</p>

<h3 id="is-it-all">Is it all?</h3>
<p>Now you have an emergency fund and you know you won’t be like before the last time you were in real emergency. and also just because building the fund won’t make you financially independ or free or and you still have to monitor your fund and keep funding it if you ever use your emergency fund for an true emergency.</p>

<p>Being financially independ is a long journey and building your emergency fund and start the habit of saving which is known as “paying yourself fist” is a great start to the jonery we all looking forward to go towards the better finanal future and freedom and as you all want to be good investors to Invest like a Ninja, it’s must to master the habit of savings as you’ll eventually invest your savings which are not in your emergency fund, Good Luck!</p>
